# TODO

Only work that's left. Shipped items move to DONE.md, rejected ones to DROPPED.md.

## Fork housekeeping

1. **Addon catalog link.** The GitHub addon catalog (`GitHubProvider.CATALOG_URL`) still points at upstream. It can stay on upstream's nightly build (no cost, but it's their branch) or the fork's `addon-catalog` workflow can publish its own.

## Proposed by Claude, not agreed yet

- **Keyboard on the 3.3.5a login screen.** Addons can't run on the login, code and character screens, so typing there means Back, then Keyboard. Either open the keyboard by itself when the client starts, or map a controller button to it for the private server container.

- **Own the CurseForge proxy.** Release builds without a key send every CurseForge request to `cf.yorudev.com`, upstream's server. Either run `server/curseforge-proxy` with Daniel's own key and build with `-PCURSEFORGE_PROXY=...`, or accept upstream's server and say so in NOTES.md.
